                Wonderland has a very strange monetary system. Each Wonderland gold coin has an integer 20 written on it. A coin can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: 10,6 and 5. You can sell Wonderland coins for American dollars. The exchange rate is 1:1. But you can not buy wonderland coins. You have one wonderland gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars you can get for one wonderland gold coin?

                A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass.

                On 11 February 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo collaboration announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves, representing the first observation of a black hole merger.On <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "15" %}')">22</a> April 2019, the first direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published, following observations made by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) in 2017 of the supermassive black hole in Messier <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "13" %}')">30</a>'s galactic centre. As of 20<a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "9" %}')">21</a>, the nearest known body thought to be a black hole is around 1,500 light-years (460 parsecs) away (see list of nearest black holes). Though only a couple dozen black holes have been found so far in the Milky Way, there are thought to be hundreds of millions, most of which are solitary and do not cause emission of radiation. Therefore, they would only be detectable by gravitational lensing.
