            <p style="color: rgba(247, 234, 205, 0.91);">Mr. Evan who is an engineer by profession is getting retired after working in Amazon for more than 20 years. His collegues has arranged a farewell party for him and invited him. He has dressed up as a gentle man but he is missing a pair of black socks to match his shoes. He has 53 socks in his drawer , 21 identical blue , 15 identical black , 17 identical red. Unfortunately there is a power cut in his house so he cannot perfectly identify the colors of socks . Can you help him by telling him how many minimum number of socks he must take out from his drawer in order to make sure he has a pair of black socks.

            <p>Albert Einstein ( 14 March 1879 – <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "12" %}')">18</a> April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius" in his <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "6" %}')">30</a>s.</p>
            <p>
                Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In eighteen ninety seven, at the age of <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "1" %}')">17</a>, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in nineteen hundred. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian.

                In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, of Jewish origin, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government;he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in nineteen <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "6" %}')">forty</a>.On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.
