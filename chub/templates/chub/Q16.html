            <p>Hercules is a constellation named after Hercules, the Roman mythological hero adapted from the Greek hero Heracles. Hercules was one of the <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "12" %}')">twenty nine</a> constellations listed by the second-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is the fifth-largest of the modern constellations and is the largest of the 50 which have no stars brighter than apparent magnitude +2.5.</p>
            <p>
                Hercules has no first or second magnitude stars. However, it does have several stars above magnitude 4. Alpha Herculis, traditionally called Rasalgethi, is a triple star system, partly resolvable in small amateur telescopes, 359 light-years from Earth. Its common name means "the kneeler's head". The primary is an irregular variable star; it is a bright giant with a minimum magnitude of 4 and a maximum magnitude of 3. It has a diameter of roughly 400 solar diameters.The secondary, a spectroscopic binary that orbits the primary every 3600 years, is a blue-green hued star of magnitude 5.6. Beta Herculis, also called Kornephoros, is the brightest star in Hercules. It is a yellow giant of magnitude 2.8, 148 light-years from Earth; kornephoros means club-bearer. Delta Herculis A is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.1, and is 78 light-years from Earth. The optical companion is of magnitude 8.2. Gamma Herculis is also a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white giant of magnitude 3.8, 195 light-years from Earth. The optical companion, widely separated, is <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "8" %}')">10</a> th magnitude. Zeta Herculis is a binary star that is becoming divisible in medium-aperture amateur telescopes, as the components widen to their peak in 2025. The system, 35 light-years from Earth, has a period of 34.5 years. The primary is a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 2.9 and the secondary is an orange star of magnitude 5.7

                <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "10" %}')">20</a> Herculis is a single star located around 351 light years away from the Sun in the northern constellation of Hercules, a few <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "17" %}')">15</a> degrees away from Omega Herculis. It has the Bayer designation h Herculis, while 29 Herculis is the Flamsteed designation. This star is visible to the naked eye as a faint, orange-hued point of light with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.84. It is moving further from the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of +3 km/s. The star has a relatively high proper motion, traversing the celestial sphere at the rate of 0.195 arc seconds per annum.
