                In the stock market, a person buys a stock and sells it on some future date. Given the stock prices of 12 days. Find out the maximum profit a person can make in at most 4 transactions. A transaction is equivalent to (buying + selling) of stock and a new transaction can start only when the previous transaction has been completed.

                Google Earth is a computer program that renders a 3D representation of <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "8" %}')">Earth</a> based primarily on satellite imagery. The program maps the Earth by superimposing satellite images, aerial photography, and GIS data onto a 3D globe, allowing users to see cities and landscapes from various angles. Users can explore the globe by entering addresses and coordinates, or by using a keyboard or <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "8" %}')">mouse</a>. The program can also be downloaded on a smartphone or tablet, using a touch screen or stylus to navigate. Users may use the program to add their own data using Keyhole Markup Language and upload them through various sources, such as forums or blogs. Google Earth is able to show various kinds of images overlaid on the surface of the earth and is also a Web Map Service client. In <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "8" %}')">2019</a>, Google has revealed that Google Earth now covers more than <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "8" %}')">97</a> percent of the world, and has captured <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "8" %}')">10</a> million miles of Street View imagery, in <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "22" %}')">1185</a> cities.          
              </p>

                Google Earth shows 3D building models in some cities, including photorealistic 3D imagery made using photogrammetry. The first 3D buildings in Google Earth were created using <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "8" %}')">3D</a> modeling applications such as SketchUp and, beginning in <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "8" %}')">2009</a>, Building Maker, and were uploaded to Google Earth via the 3D Warehouse. In June <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "8" %}')">2012</a>, Google announced that it would be replacing user-generated 3D buildings with an auto-generated 3D mesh. This would be phased in, starting with select larger cities, with the notable exception of cities such as London and Toronto which required more time to process detailed imagery of their vast number of buildings. The reason given is to have greater uniformity in 3D buildings and to compete with Nokia Here and Apple Maps, which were already using this technology. The coverage began that year in 21 cities in four countries. By early <a onclick="window.location.replace('{% url "10" %}')">2016</a>, 3D imagery had been expanded to hundreds of cities in over 40 countries, including every U.S. state and encompassing every continent except Antarctica.
