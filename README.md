<h2><b>What is This?</b></h2>


A web based question and answer game in which we have to give correct answers continuously in order to reach the end. If at any point we give any wrong answer then we will be directed to a question which is farther from the end point.  

<h2>Why did we build this?</h2>

This was created for the Junior squad (class 9 and 10) qualified for Technothlon Mains, conducted during Techniche'22 between 1st and 4th September,at Indian Institute Of Technology, Guwahati, after clearing Technothlon prelims conducted on 31st July, 2022.<br>
Technothlon is an international school championship organized by the student fraternity of IIT Guwahati. Technothlon began in 2004 in a small room with an aim to
"Inspire Young Minds" . Starting on our journey with a participation of 200 students confined to the city of Guwahati, over the past 15 years we have expanded our reach to over 400 cities all over India and various centers abroad. Now Technothlon spans its wings in 30+ countries internationally. Technothlon is not just an exam but it is an enthralling journey on the path of logic which will test your logical and creative thinking to its limit. The championship is organized over 2 rounds : Prelims and Mains.
